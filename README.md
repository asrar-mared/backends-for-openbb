# OpenBB Workspace

## Introduction

An OpenBB Workspace Data Integration is a versatile way to connect your data to widgets inside OpenBB Workspace. Whether hosted internally or externally, this method provides a standardized structure that OpenBB Workspace widgets can read and then display any data.

Note: Most of the examples provided use Python FastAPI due to our familiarity with the library, but the same could be done utilizing different languages.

The Main tenants are:

1. **Data returned should be in JSON format** (Note : you can utilize the "dataKey" variable in the widgets.json if you have nested JSON.)

<details>
    <summary>Example JSON</summary>

    ```json
    [
      {
        "ticker": "AAPL",
        "name": "Apple Inc.",
        "price": 150.5,
        "marketCap": 2500000000,
        "change": 1.25
      },
      {
        "ticker": "GOOGL",
        "name": "Alphabet Inc.",
        "price": 2800.75,
        "marketCap": 1900000000,
        "change": -0.75
      },
      {
        "ticker": "MSFT",
        "name": "Microsoft Corporation",
        "price": 300.25,
        "marketCap": 220000000,
        "change": 0.98
      },
    ]
    ```

</details>

2. **An endpoint returning a ```widgets.json``` file** : This file defines widget properties such as name, description, category, type, endpoint, and other information. Each widget will be defined in this file – You can find the format in any of the templates folder with a detailed definition below.

3. **CORS Enabled** : If hosting locally you must enable [CORS](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/).

4. **Adding Authentication (optional)** : If your backend requires authentication we offer the ability to set a query param or header when you connect to it through OpenBB Pro. These values are sent on every request when configured. If you require another method - please reach out to us.

## Getting Started

We recommend starting with the [getting-started/hello-world](getting-started/hello-world/README.md) example.

Then Moving on to the [getting-started/reference-backend](getting-started/reference-backend/README.md).

This will give you a good understanding of how to setup your own backend and connect it to OpenBB Workspace.

### Leveraging AI

If you are utilizing a coding agent to build your OpenBB backend, we recommend:
- Utilizing the following MCP Server to enhance coding agent with OpenBB docs: [https://smithery.ai/server/@DidierRLopes/openbb-docs-mcp](https://smithery.ai/server/@DidierRLopes/openbb-docs-mcp)
- Or providing the entire documentation to the agent in markdown format by copy-pasting this link into context: [https://docs.openbb.co/workspace/llms-full.txt](https://docs.openbb.co/workspace/llms-full.txt).

For more examples on setting up your own App - you can head to our documentation at [https://docs.openbb.co/workspace](https://docs.openbb.co/workspace).
